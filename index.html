    <div class="section-title">Introduction</div>
    <p>
      Canopy Growth Corporation is a global leader in the cannabis industry with a mission to improve lives through the transformative power of cannabis. The company offers a diverse range of products, from cannabis flower and vapes to edibles and beverages. Despite its strong mission and extensive product line, Canopy has recently faced challenges in the stock market, with shares slipping by 3.90%. Regulatory hurdles and market saturation are among the key challenges that need to be addressed.

    <!-- Detailed Proposed Business Model Section -->
    <div class="section-title">Proposed Business Model</div>
    <p>
      The proposed business model aims to leverage Canopy's strong consumer insights and the changing regulatory landscape in the U.S. With the U.S. moving towards reclassifying cannabis as a lower-risk substance, there is an opportunity for market expansion. The new model proposes diversifying the product range to include more wellness and skincare products. Additionally, Canopy should focus on strengthening its corporate citizenship initiatives to align with its mission of using cannabis for positive change.
