    <p>
      Canopy Growth Corporation is a global leader in the cannabis industry, dedicated to improving lives through the power of cannabis. The company manufactures a wide range of products, including cannabis flower, vapes, edibles, and beverages. Despite its mission and extensive product line, the company's stock has recently underperformed in the market. This analysis aims to understand the current process flow and propose a new business model to address these challenges.

    <!-- Proposed Business Model Section -->
    <div class="section-title">Proposed Business Model</div>
    <p>
      The proposed business model focuses on leveraging Canopy's consumer insights to guide innovations. With the U.S. moving towards easing cannabis regulations, there is an opportunity for Canopy to expand its market share in the U.S. The new model will focus on product diversification and entering new markets, especially those where cannabis is being reclassified as a lower-risk substance.
