    <!-- Detailed Proposed Business Model Section -->
    <div class="section-title">Proposed Business Model</div>
    <p>
      The proposed business model aims to leverage Canopy's strong consumer insights and the changing regulatory landscape in the U.S. With the U.S. moving towards reclassifying cannabis as a lower-risk substance, there is an opportunity for market expansion. The new model proposes diversifying the product range to include more wellness and skincare products. Additionally, Canopy should focus on strengthening its corporate citizenship initiatives to align with its mission of using cannabis for positive change.
