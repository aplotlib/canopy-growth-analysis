        <!-- 2a. Causal Loop Diagram (DOMESTIC Sales) -->
        <h2>2a. Causal Loop Diagram for DOMESTIC Sales</h2>
       o elucidate the supply-demand dynamics in the context of DOMESTIC sales, a causal loop diagram was developed. This diagram includes a minimum of 10 entities, which represent various factors influencing the supply and demand of Canopy Growth Corporation's cannabis edibles in the domestic market.
The logic behind this diagram is to illustrate how changes in factors such as production capacity, pricing, and consumer preferences can affect the overall supply and demand equilibrium. The diagram captures both reinforcing and balancing feedback loops that play a crucial role in shaping market dynamics (Sterman, 2000).
        <p>Below is the causal loop diagram for the supply-demand model with DOMESTIC sales:</p>
    <img src="Casual Loop CGC.png" alt="Causal Loop">
The causal loop diagram for DOMESTIC sales provides insights into the interdependencies between various factors influencing the supply and demand of Canopy Growth Corporation's cannabis edibles in the domestic market (Sterman, 2000). For instance, an increase in production capacity might lead to a decrease in product price, which in turn could boost consumer demand. Conversely, a surge in consumer preferences for a particular product variant might necessitate adjustments in production schedules (Leafly, 2023). The reinforcing loops indicate factors that amplify changes, while the balancing loops show factors that counteract or stabilize changes. Understanding these dynamics helps in making informed decisions related to production, pricing, and marketing strategies (Cannabis Business Times, 2023).

        <h2>2b. Stock and Flow Model for FOREIGN Sales</h2>

 In the context of FOREIGN sales, the stock and flow model considers multiple variables that influence the supply and demand dynamics for Canopy Growth Corporation's cannabis edibles in international markets. This model, comprising a minimum of 10 entities, provides a comprehensive understanding of how the company's products can penetrate and thrive in foreign markets.
The central logic behind this model is to examine the interactions between various factors such as export volume, market expansion strategies, and foreign consumer preferences. By visualizing these interactions, the model offers valuable insights into the company's ability to adapt its production and distribution strategies to meet the unique demands of foreign markets effectively.

    <h2>Decision Analysis</h2>
    <p>
        The "Decision Analysis" section offers insights into the strategic decisions that underpin our proposed business model. This encompasses our approach to Total Quality Control (TQC), insights into current and future trends, and a comprehensive decision tree analysis.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Total Quality Control (TQC) Analysis</h3>
    <p>
        2. Decision Analysis
2a. Total Quality Control (TQC) Analysis

Total Quality Control (TQC) is an integrated approach to achieving and sustaining high-quality products and services. For our cannabis-infused beverages:

    Quality Checks: Every batch undergoes rigorous testing for potency, purity, and consistency. This ensures that consumers get the same experience every time.

    Feedback Loop: We actively seek feedback from consumers and use it to improve our products. This iterative approach ensures continuous improvement.

    Supplier Audits: Regular audits of our suppliers ensure that the raw materials meet our stringent quality standards.

Visualization: A bar chart showing the number of quality checks passed vs. total checks conducted over the past 12 months can demonstrate our commitment to quality.
2b. Current and Future Trends

    Current Trends: The acceptance of cannabis products is on the rise, with more states legalizing its use. There's a growing demand for alternative consumption methods, like beverages, over traditional smoking.

    Future Trends: As research into the health benefits of cannabis continues, it would be wise to anticipate a surge in demand for wellness-focused products. Blockchain traceability will become a standard, ensuring transparency and building trust.

2c. Decision Tree Analysis

The decision tree will help upper management decide whether to invest in the proposed business model. Here's a simplified breakdown:

    Decision Node: Invest in the new business model or not.
        Outcome 1: If invested:
            Probability Node: 70% chance of high returns due to market demand and unique selling proposition.
            Probability Node: 30% chance of moderate returns due to unforeseen market changes.
        Outcome 2: If not invested:
            Probability Node: 90% chance of stagnant growth as competitors innovate.
            Probability Node: 10% chance of slight growth due to existing brand loyalty.

Recommendations:
Based on the analyses from Week 1 to Week 3, we recommend investing in the new business model. The potential for high returns, combined with the growing market demand and our unique blockchain traceability system, presents a compelling case. Not investing poses a risk of stagnant growth as the industry evolves.
        <li>Continuous monitoring of production processes.</li>
        <li>Regular training sessions for our staff to keep them updated with the latest quality standards.</li>
