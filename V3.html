    Introduction
In this section, we will analyze the business model proposed for Canopy Growth Corporation, focusing on business process improvements and sales strategies. This analysis aims to enhance the efficiency and profitability of the company's operations.
        <p>Please find below the event simulation flowchart for Canopy Growth:</p>
    <img src="adbbbbbb.png" alt="Event Simulation Flowchart">

To enhance the understanding of the proposed business process, an event simulation flowchart has been designed. This flowchart represents the logic of key events in the cannabis edibles manufacturing process. The flowchart consists of various entities, each representing a critical step in the process (Canopy Growth Corporation, n.d.).
The event simulation flowchart for Canopy Growth Corporation's cannabis edibles manufacturing process is designed to provide a visual representation of the entire production cycle. Starting from the procurement of raw materials to the final packaging and distribution, each entity in the flowchart represents a distinct phase (Canopy Growth Corporation, n.d.). The flowchart also highlights the decision-making points, quality checks, and potential bottlenecks in the process. By understanding the flow of events, stakeholders can identify areas of improvement and optimize the production for efficiency and quality 
      
    <!-- 1b. Sales Strategy and Analysis -->
        <h2>1b. Sales Strategy and Analysis</h2>
        <p>Our sales strategy for the new business process is as follows:</p>
    The new business process for Canopy Growth Corporation entails significant changes, including automated quality checks, AI-driven production planning, and expanded storage capacity. These improvements are expected to impact the company's sales strategy positively.
To assess the feasibility of the proposed concepts and determine the probability of success, a sales analysis was performed. Analytical algorithms were employed to evaluate potential sales scenarios and outcomes. The Power BI tool was utilized to create visualizations for better comprehension.
The analysis considered various factors, including market demand, pricing strategies, and competition. By integrating historical sales data and projected growth, we can estimate the potential revenue increase resulting from the new business process.

        <!-- 2a. Causal Loop Diagram (DOMESTIC Sales) -->
        <h2>2a. Causal Loop Diagram for DOMESTIC Sales</h2>
       o elucidate the supply-demand dynamics in the context of DOMESTIC sales, a causal loop diagram was developed. This diagram includes a minimum of 10 entities, which represent various factors influencing the supply and demand of Canopy Growth Corporation's cannabis edibles in the domestic market.
The logic behind this diagram is to illustrate how changes in factors such as production capacity, pricing, and consumer preferences can affect the overall supply and demand equilibrium. The diagram captures both reinforcing and balancing feedback loops that play a crucial role in shaping market dynamics (Sterman, 2000).
        <p>Below is the causal loop diagram for the supply-demand model with DOMESTIC sales:</p>
    <img src="Casual Loop CGC.png" alt="Causal Loop">
The causal loop diagram for DOMESTIC sales provides insights into the interdependencies between various factors influencing the supply and demand of Canopy Growth Corporation's cannabis edibles in the domestic market (Sterman, 2000). For instance, an increase in production capacity might lead to a decrease in product price, which in turn could boost consumer demand. Conversely, a surge in consumer preferences for a particular product variant might necessitate adjustments in production schedules (Leafly, 2023). The reinforcing loops indicate factors that amplify changes, while the balancing loops show factors that counteract or stabilize changes. Understanding these dynamics helps in making informed decisions related to production, pricing, and marketing strategies (Cannabis Business Times, 2023).
      
      
        <!-- 2b. Stock and Flow Model (FOREIGN Sales) -->
        <h2>2b. Stock and Flow Model for FOREIGN Sales</h2>

 In the context of FOREIGN sales, the stock and flow model considers multiple variables that influence the supply and demand dynamics for Canopy Growth Corporation's cannabis edibles in international markets. This model, comprising a minimum of 10 entities, provides a comprehensive understanding of how the company's products can penetrate and thrive in foreign markets.
The central logic behind this model is to examine the interactions between various factors such as export volume, market expansion strategies, and foreign consumer preferences. By visualizing these interactions, the model offers valuable insights into the company's ability to adapt its production and distribution strategies to meet the unique demands of foreign markets effectively.

The central logic behind this model is to examine the interactions between various factors such as export volume, market expansion strategies, and foreign consumer preferences. By visualizing these interactions, the model offers valuable insights into the company's ability to adapt its production and distribution strategies to meet the unique demands of foreign markets effectively. Additionally, the model emphasizes the importance of understanding the regulatory landscape in foreign countries, as this can significantly impact the company's ability to export and sell its products. It also highlights the role of cultural differences in shaping consumer preferences and the need for the company to tailor its marketing strategies accordingly.

Furthermore, as international markets present a diverse range of challenges and opportunities, the stock and flow model underscores the importance of continuous market research and feedback mechanisms. This ensures that the company remains agile and responsive to changing market conditions, thereby maximizing its potential for success in foreign markets.
