        <h2>2a. Causal Loop Diagram for DOMESTIC Sales</h2>
        
        <p>
            To elucidate the supply-demand dynamics in the context of DOMESTIC sales, here a causal loop diagram is presented. This diagram encompasses a minimum of 10 entities, representing various factors that influence the supply and demand of Canopy Growth Corporation's cannabis edibles in the domestic market.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The primary purpose of this diagram is to illustrate the interplay of factors such as production capacity, pricing, and consumer preferences, and how they impact the overall supply and demand equilibrium. Importantly, the diagram captures both reinforcing and balancing feedback loops, which are pivotal in shaping market dynamics (Sterman, 2000).

        <p>
            The causal loop diagram offers insights into the intricate interdependencies between various factors influencing the domestic market's supply and demand for Canopy Growth Corporation's cannabis edibles (Sterman, 2000). For example, an uptick in production capacity might lead to a price reduction, potentially boosting consumer demand. On the flip side, a rise in consumer preference for a specific product variant could necessitate production adjustments (Leafly, 2023). Reinforcing loops highlight factors that amplify changes, while balancing loops indicate factors that counteract or stabilize these changes. Grasping these dynamics is instrumental in making informed decisions related to production, pricing, and marketing strategies (Cannabis Business Times, 2023).

    <h2>Decision Analysis</h2>
    <p>
        The "Decision Analysis" section delves into the strategic decisions that shape our proposed business model. This includes our commitment to Total Quality Control (TQC), insights into prevailing and upcoming trends, and an in-depth decision tree analysis (Rajgopal, n.d.).
    </p>
    
    <!-- Total Quality Control (TQC) Analysis -->
    <h3>Total Quality Control (TQC) Analysis</h3>
    <p>
        Total Quality Control (TQC) represents a holistic approach to achieving and maintaining high-quality products and services. For our cannabis-infused beverages:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Quality Checks:</strong> Each batch is subjected to stringent testing for potency, purity, and consistency, ensuring a consistent consumer experience (Canopy Growth, 2020, November 5).</li>
        <li><strong>Feedback Loop:</strong> Canopy can proactively gather feedback from our consumers, leveraging it to refine our products and champion continuous improvement (Thompson-Richards, A., 2023, March 29).</li>
        <li><strong>Supplier Audits:</strong> Periodic audits of our suppliers guarantee that the raw materials align with our rigorous quality criteria (Universal Teacher Publications, n.d.).</li>
        <li><strong>Visualization:</strong> A bar chart depicting the total defects discovered over the last 7 days underscores our dedication to quality and detecting defective products early.</li>

    <h3>Insights into Current and Future Trends</h3>
<p>
    As the market landscape continues to evolve, Canopy should stay attuned to emerging trends that could shape our business trajectory. Current trends highlight the increasing acceptance of cannabis products, a surge in demand for alternative consumption methods, and a shift towards wellness-centric products (Future Market Insights, 2022, October). Moving forward, one should foresee research on cannabis health benefits, standardization of blockchain traceability, and the expansion of the wellness sector as pivotal industry drivers.
</p>

<h3>Decision Tree Analysis</h3>
<p>
    Our decision tree analysis offers a systematic approach to assess the potential outcomes of our proposed business model. By weighing different scenarios and their respective probabilities, Canopy can make decisions that resonate with our strategic goals.
</p>

<p>
    Drawing from our in-depth analysis spanning Week 1 to Week 3, this analyst advocates for investment in the new cannabis beverage business model. The prospect of lucrative returns, coupled with rising market demand and our innovative blockchain traceability system, presents a strong argument (CFI Team, 2020, June 25; Updated 2023, May 11). Choosing not to invest could lead to stagnant growth amidst industry evolution.
</p>

<h4>Recommendations for Upper Management:</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Invest in R&D:</strong> Continuous innovation is paramount. Delving into new flavors and wellness-centric ingredients can distinguish the brand.</li>
    <li><strong>Expand Strategically:</strong> Prioritize states with a growing openness to cannabis products.</li>
    <li><strong>Engage with the Community:</strong> Organizing wellness events and educational initiatives can cultivate brand loyalty.</li>
    <li><strong>Collaborate:</strong> Forming alliances with celebrities or influencers can amplify brand awareness.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    The proposed business model, underpinned by meticulous research and analysis, offers a lucrative venture in the flourishing cannabis beverage sector. The growth potential, combined with a commitment to quality and customer engagement, underscores its investment appeal.
